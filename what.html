                <h1>What are NFTs?</h1>
                <p> So you want to learn more about NFTs! They can be a confusing topic, indeed, but to keep it simple try to understand them as none other than a digital image. NFTs are pieces of art (digital) that are sold on various online marketplaces. These online marketplaces vary; some are just for NBA players (NBA Topshot) and some are for multiple categories (Crypto.com). Nevertheless, these NFTs are exclusive. 
                </p>
                <p>NFTs are limited in supply. Some companies/artists sell thousands of them, some sell only 1, making it more exclusive. Take these NFTs for example: </p>

                <p>These NFTs are are the only one's available in the market and they sell for 0-5 Ethereum. Now, I'm not saying that you will be able to sell these at a higher price, but the point is that they're rare; no one person will have those same NFTs. That's the beauty of NFTs. You can make money, collect beautiful art, and show off your sweet collection of NFTs.</p>
                <p>NFTs are stored in a blockchain. This blockchain contains all the information that each specific NFT has, and each one has a different blockchain entry, making it rare/exclusive. Each NFT marketplace has their own wallet, and with that wallet you can hold your NFTs that you buy. Make sure you keep your wallet secure, and never share you security phrases with anyone. There are ways to keep wallets even more secure, but for time purposes, you can google that (99% of beginners won't need to worry about that anyways).</p>

                <p> I personally am an NBA fan, so I have been very interested in NBA Topshot, NBA's official NFT marketplace. You can collect player cards, with the ability to create high profits and if you're a collector like me, you will feel satisfied with owning all those NBA cards. Find out your purpose with NFTs. Do you want to search through the web and find an NFT that you will hold for a long time and sell to make money? Or are you interested in art and want to collect as many beautiful pieces as you can? NFTs are of interest to many people, and I'm sure you can find interest in it as well. NFTs are the future, and it is growing in popularity by the day. </p>
