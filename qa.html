            <label class="animate" for="q1">Q: Why is it called non-fungible?</label>
            <p class="response animate">A: The idea behind fungible means that there can be more of one of them. 1 BTC (Bitcoin) is fungible as multiple people can have 1 BTC; there's nothing special about that. A one-time digital trading card is not fungible because nobody else can have that trading card except you. Non-fungible tokens have a very low supply, making some the most valuable items in the world.</p>
            
            <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q2"/>
            <label class="animate" for="q2">Q: How do they work?</label>
            <p class="response animate">A: All NFTs are stored in a blockchain. With this blockchain, information is stored that keeps track of these NFTs and makes it so any specific NFT cannot be replicated or duplicated (that is, without losing its value). If you own an NFT, you can be sure that the item you hold will not always be easy to obtain, if at all. There are NFTs that have thousands in stock, and some only one. Regardless, they are inrenewable.</p>
            
            <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q3"/>
            <label class="animate" for="q3">Q: So what? Why would I want to buy an NFT?</label>
            <p class="response animate">A: Buyers can support their favorite artists, companies, and players by buying certain types of NFTs. You can also sell those NFTs, and if planned strategically, big money can be made. NFT artists and sellers can also gain lots of fame for making their own NFTs, as well as selling their art. If you want to make money, NFTs might be for you. If you like to collect items, NFTs might be for you. If you're human, NFTs might be for you.</p>
            
            <input class="animate" type="radio" name="question" id="q4"/>
            <label class="animate" for="q4">Q: Which NFTs should I buy?</label>
            <p class="response animate">A: Check out one of the sites I listed on the "Popular NFT Marketplaces" page. OpenSea is my favorite, and you can check out the various types of digital art they sell. You are free to choose what interests you, or what gives you the most value. 9 times out of 10, you can research its estimate value and decide for yourself whether you want to buy it. You can also go for auctions, that can give high return.</p>

            <label class="animate" for="q5">Q: I have more questions. How can you help me?</label>
            <p class="response animate">A: I'd be more than happy to help you. Send me an e-mail with your questions and I will do my best in updating the site towards your preferences.</p>
